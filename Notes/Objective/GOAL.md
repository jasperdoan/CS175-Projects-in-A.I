## This is my scientific motivation and approach:

Using a supervised learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), I can classify microscopy images of mouse fibroblasts into different levels of radiation damage. Process:
    - Preprocess the data by cropping the images to the cell region and resizing them to a standardized size. 
    - Augment the data by applying random rotations, flips, and other transformations to increase the size of the dataset and improve the model's robustness.

#### Potential goal:
- To interpret the type of radiation experienced, I can use domain knowledge and metadata provided in the dataset to classify the images into Fe or X-Ray radiation. Perhaps making use of a unsupervised techniques, such as clustering and dimensionality reduction, to identify distinct patterns in the images and extract features that are most relevant to the radiation damage.

- To predict the level of damage done to DNA given the amount of radiation experienced, I could train the model to predict the radiation dose from the microscopy images using regression techniques. You can then use the predicted dose to estimate the level of damage based on the dose-response relationship of radiation.

Then finally drawing conclusions about the risks of space radiation exposure to humans, I can extrapolate the results to estimate the potential risks and identify the most vulnerable populations based on genetic susceptibility, exposure duration, and other factors... This is a bit of a stretch since it is out of my field (Biology) and requires some research, but I think it's a good goal to aim for.
