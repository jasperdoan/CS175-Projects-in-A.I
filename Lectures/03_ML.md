# Machine Learning

#### Background:
Motivation: Austronaut's Health
Radiation: Exposure to radiation causes DNA to be damanged
Experiments: Mouse data, where accelerated particle are shoot to them, and record them. In `.tif` format

Pattern: Dots within the cell mice image, after a certain amount of time
Data: The data is flattened, image is not the same size
Dataset: Fe, Ar, X-ray into mice cells


Augmentation: Generative techniques or classical ML techniques

Need help with model trainin; proposed solution:
- Super Resolution
- GNNs
- Supervised Learning / Unsupervised Learning / Self-Supervised Learning
- How to test weaknesses of the model

### Speaker: Emma Benjaminson
- Take a look at is classifying cells in according to theri genes
    + Was it a healthy/unhealthy cell?
    + Autoencoder?

- Segment images and label them as a node --> Connect them together as a graph
    + Some region might be spreading the damage faster etc..
    + Segment graph into different regions

- Process suggestion:
    + Build a complete pipeline (as quick as possible), doesn't have to be good. Then add complexity to it
    + Think about the metrics you care about
    + Clustering data
    + Build: Juptyer notebook
    + Use off the shelf models --> Just to see what works

- Multiple features you are training on?
    + Manually try to see if they are collarated to positive samples --> Use it to see model is agreeing with you

- Time series data can shift over time --> Maybe plot the average intensity over time (?)

- Pyseries model can make assumptions that might not be true

- Exisiting statistical tools may help

- Use an MLP before doing anything to check if it even works


### Speaker: William Bryon / Andres M-J
- Model selection:
    + Forget about ML --> Histograms everything you can --> Look at the data
    + Data is already well seperated why ML?

- Too complex

- Start with absolute barebone, minimum viable product
    + Start with a simple model
    + Just start with the 6 hours data set, just to see where that goes

- Explain and do literature review of the problem. THe inoziation of the cells

- Build into pipeline --> Start with simpliest thing like an app on streamlit --> Then API it

- Then after all of it you can then apply some Deep ML models

- Try to go for something someone has already build --> Use a set of weights 

- If you're training from scratch, you might need a GPU

- Recall would be better here!!!!
