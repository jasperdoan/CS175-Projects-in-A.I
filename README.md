## Course Description
Students in this project class will work in teams to develop artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms with a particular focus on natural language and text analysis. Students in this class will work in small teams (2-3 students each) to develop artificial intellegence and machine learning algorithms and apply them to solve real-world problems. This quarter, we will work on **[Nadia decides to keep it a secret for now :/]**. Throughout the process, we will review and learn various machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, SVM, and deep neural nets. We will also review popular machine learning tools and packages, such as CNNs and Transformers, Weights and Biases, and pytorch, in conjuction with ML front end w/ Gradio or Streamlit. The programming language used in this class will be based on Python.


## Side note
- This class is an upper division class at UCI, and I'm currently auditing it as a sophomore at Saddleback College (for fun and because I don't like myself so I'm adding this on to my already dreading schedule of 18.5 units, HITS-SDO, Tutoring, and Saddleback Robotics üòÅ).
- I expect to fully complete this class by the end of the quarter, and I will be updating this repository as I go along.
- Though I anticipate that I won't be able to take notes on every single lecture as I tend to drift off and focus more on the lecture than taking notes, so some of the notes may be incomplete or missing.
- This will be my first time taking a class at UCI, as I've yet to transfer and even figured out parking, but I will be doing my best to complete all the assignments and projects.
- I will be using this repository as a way to keep track of my progress and to keep myself accountable for my work.
- This will also be a fun experiment for me to see if this whole schedule of mine is sustainable or not. And whether I could pull off similar schedules in the future. Hungry learner, I guess. üòÅ


## Personal Learning Goals
- Learn how to use Python to implement:
    + Machine learning / Deep learning algorithms
    + Natural language processing algorithms
    + Data visualization
- Learn how to use popular machine learning tools, packages, and libraries such as PyTorch
- Make use of the knowledge and skills learned in this class to solve real-world problems
- Easily recognize and understand the given problem and formulate it as a machine learning problem while also being able to identify the appropriate data structure and algorithm to solve the problem
- Learn how to work in a team and collaborate with others
- Learn how to present and communicate technical information to a non-technical audience
